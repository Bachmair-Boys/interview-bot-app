# Interview Bot App
Android app that generates interview questions with multiple question types. Created using Android Studio and can be immediately exported as an APK to download on any Android device version 5.0 or greater. 

Simple interface where the user can choose a question type from a dropdown menu and click the generate button to display a question for the category. Questions are pulled from an external database server that needs to run seperately. The server repository with setup instructions can be found here: https://github.com/Bachmair-Boys/roboggle-server. 

The app allows the user to submit their own questions. The user can click a button which leads to a new android activity that can allow the user to choose the interview question category and type in the question. Clicking the submit button will submit the question to the server (which also must already be running).
